Hi, I'm Alison Hill and I'm your instructor for this course on working with data using the R programming language.

We'll use tools from the tidyverse to explore, tame, tidy, and transform data.

You'll work with data from a popular television baking competition called "The Great British Bake-Off." You'll start by learning to read and explore data files in R, while getting to know more about the show and the bakers. Next, you'll learn how to tame your variable types, names, and values, using data about each episode's bakes and ratings.

In the third chapter, you'll learn why and how to tidy data. In the tidy masterclass at the end, you'll examine whether a spoiler tweet spoiled a finale for viewers. Finally, you'll get a taste for transforming data, like how to conditionally recode variables, and how to work with tricky variable types like factors, dates, and strings.

Throughout the course, we'll use incremental exercises to help you build up sequences of code using the pipe operator to effectively work with your own data. I look forward to seeing you in the course. 

On your marks, get set, CODE!

Notes:

On slide where I introduce GBBO as dataset, perhaps full image slide with nice photo? Some ideas:

For start of third chapter on tidying, I was thinking we could quickly cycle between these images (but, I don't want to totally spoil the exercises- I could remove the titles?):

At very end maybe?
