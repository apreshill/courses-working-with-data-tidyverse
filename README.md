## Description

In this course, you'll learn to work with data using tools from the tidyverse in R. By data, we mean your own data, other people's data, messy data, big data, small data - any data stored in a "flat file" that comes your way. By work, we mean doing most of the things that sound hard to do with R, and that need to happen **before** you can analyze or visualize your data. But work doesn't mean that it is not fun - you will see why so many people love working in the tidyverse!

## Learning objectives

*The learning objectives should be specific and action-oriented. What are the key takeaways from your course? Here are some examples:*

* Learn principles of exploratory data analysis while using a combination of tools
* Practice manipulating data with dplyr and visualizing data with ggplot2
* Practice using packages in the core tidyverse: dplyr, tidyr, and readr
* Be exposed to the suite of tidyverse packages tailored for more specialized use including readxl, haven, janitor, lubridate, stringr, and forcats

## Prerequisites
