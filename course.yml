title: Working with Data in the Tidyverse
description: In this course, you'll learn to work with data using tools from the tidyverse
  in R. By data, we mean your own data, other people's data, messy data, big data,
  small data - any data with rows and columns that comes your way! By work, we mean
  doing most of the things that sound hard to do with R, and that need to happen before
  you can analyze or visualize your data. But work doesn't mean that it is not fun
  - you will see why so many people love working in the tidyverse as you learn how to explore,
  tame, tidy, and transform your data. Throughout this course, you'll work with data from a
  popular television baking competition called "The Great British Bake Off."
